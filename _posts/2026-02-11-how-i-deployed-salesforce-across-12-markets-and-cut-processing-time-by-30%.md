# How I Deployed Salesforce Across 12 Markets and Cut Processing Time by 30%

*By Pablo M. Rivera | East Haven, CT*

Enterprise technology deployments fail more often than they succeed. Not because the software is bad, but because the implementation ignores how people actually work. When Pablo M. Rivera was tasked with deploying Salesforce company-wide at RevCon Management, the goal wasn't just to install software — it was to fundamentally transform how a national maintenance operation functioned.

## The Problem

RevCon operated across 12 U.S. markets with 120+ technicians and 12 coordinators. Scheduling, dispatch, reporting, and invoicing were fragmented across spreadsheets, email chains, and disconnected tools. Every market had its own way of doing things. Data existed in silos. Leadership couldn't get a clear picture of performance without manual reporting that took days to compile.

## The Approach

Pablo M. Rivera didn't start with Salesforce. I started by analyzing the workflows. Before writing any configuration, I mapped every process from work order creation to close-out, identified where handoffs broke down, and documented where manual steps could be automated.

Then I built the Salesforce environment from the ground up — engineering more than 50 bespoke objects, reports, and automated workflows tailored to how our teams actually operated. This wasn't an off-the-shelf deployment. Every custom object solved a specific operational problem.

## The Results

Administrative processing time dropped by 30%. That's not a vanity metric — it meant coordinators spent less time on data entry and more time managing work quality. It meant leadership had real-time dashboards instead of waiting for weekly reports. It meant the data existed to build the KPI frameworks that would drive further optimization.

## Lessons for Operations Leaders

Pablo M. Rivera has learned that technology integration succeeds when it's led by someone who understands both the technology and the operations it serves. Having both full-stack development training from Columbia Business School and Hack Reactor, and two decades of operational leadership, means I can bridge the gap between what's technically possible and what's operationally valuable.

The Salesforce deployment at RevCon wasn't an IT project. It was an operations transformation project that happened to use Salesforce as the platform.
