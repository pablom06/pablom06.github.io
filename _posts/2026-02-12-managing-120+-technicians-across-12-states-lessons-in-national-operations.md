# Managing 120+ Technicians Across 12 States: Lessons in National Operations

*By Pablo M. Rivera | East Haven, CT*

Running a local operation is hard. Running a national one across 12 states with 120+ field technicians is a completely different challenge. As National Director of Maintenance at RevCon Management, Pablo M. Rivera rebuilt the operational infrastructure that made it possible — and learned lessons that apply to any leader scaling across geography.

## Standardization Is Freedom

A counterintuitive truth about managing dispersed teams is that standardization creates autonomy. When Pablo M. Rivera unified scheduling, dispatch, and reporting under standardized workflows across all 12 markets, technicians and coordinators didn't feel constrained — they felt empowered. They knew exactly what was expected, how to escalate issues, and where to find the information they needed.

The result: measurable improvements in cost and time efficiency across every market.

## You Can't Manage What You Can't Measure

Pablo M. Rivera designed and implemented a comprehensive KPI framework at RevCon that tracked job completion rates, repair cycle times, cost per service call, and margin performance. This wasn't reporting for reporting's sake — it was the foundation for every resourcing decision, vendor evaluation, and strategic adjustment.

When you're managing operations across 12 states from a remote position, real-time data isn't a luxury. It's how you lead.

## Coaching Multiplies Impact

Directly managing 120+ technicians isn't feasible. But coaching and developing the 12 coordinators who manage them is. Pablo M. Rivera implemented structured performance assessments that raised coordinator productivity by 18%. That 18% improvement multiplied across every technician they supervised.

## The 95% Standard

Escalated cases — the problems that have already failed the normal process — are where reputations are made or broken. Pablo M. Rivera's cross-functional coordination approach achieved a 95% on-time closure rate for escalated cases at RevCon. That standard came from clear ownership, documented processes, and relentless follow-through.
