# The $1 Billion Restructuring: Lessons in Financial Operations

*By Pablo M. Rivera | East Haven, CT*

As Vice President of Textron Financial's Resort Finance Division, Pablo M. Rivera led the restructuring of $1 billion in developer debt during one of the most turbulent periods in financial history. The lessons from that experience continue to inform how I approach operations leadership today.

## Finding What Others Missed

Before restructuring could begin, Pablo M. Rivera led a forensic analysis of the portfolio. The process uncovered $360 million in unreported sales — a finding that fundamentally changed the negotiating position and led to a $36 million reduction in construction-loan debt exposure.

This wasn't luck. It was the product of systematic investigation, attention to detail, and the operational discipline to document everything. In operations, the answers are usually in the data — but only if someone has the persistence and skill to find them.

## Managing Through Crisis

The restructuring required Pablo M. Rivera to manage full P&L responsibility for distressed resort and timeshare portfolios while simultaneously negotiating with four different lending groups, engaging external counsel and expert witnesses, and designing financial models that tested multiple scenarios.

The team achieved a 95% recovery rate on below-reserve dispositions, cut operational overhead by 35%, and reduced legal spend by 30% through strategic resource management. None of these results came from a single decision — they came from consistent, disciplined execution over months of complex work.

## What Financial Operations Teaches You

Managing a $4 billion loan portfolio and structuring $350 million in construction financing across the U.S. and Latin America gave Pablo M. Rivera a financial fluency that most operations leaders don't have. Understanding P&L at a granular level, building financial models, and managing capital allocation are skills that directly translate to operational leadership.

When I build KPI frameworks or design budget oversight systems today, I'm drawing on the same analytical rigor that guided billion-dollar restructuring decisions.
