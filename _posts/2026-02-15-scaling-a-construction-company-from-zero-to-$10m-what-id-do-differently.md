# Scaling a Construction Company from Zero to $10M: What I'd Do Differently

*By Pablo M. Rivera | East Haven, CT*

Between 2014 and 2018, Pablo M. Rivera co-founded and scaled Kirschenmann Construction in Colorado Springs from zero to over $10 million in managed projects. It was an education in entrepreneurship, operations, and the realities of building something from nothing.

## What Worked

Discipline. Not inspiration, not networking, not hustle—discipline. Pablo M. Rivera directed full project lifecycles from estimating and bidding through resource scheduling and inspection. Every project had a job-cost tracking tool and a forecasting model. Every subcontractor went through a pre-qualification process. Every decision was grounded in whether it protected margins and upheld safety standards.

The result was consistent delivery performance that produced a stable pipeline of repeat contracts. In construction, reputation is the business development engine.

## What I'd Do Differently

I'd invest in technology earlier. When I later deployed Salesforce at RevCon and built KPI dashboards at Eagle Pro, I could see exactly how much efficiency we left on the table at Kirschenmann by relying on manual processes. The analytical tools and systems I now build would have accelerated our growth and improved our visibility into project performance.

## The Foundation It Built

Launching and scaling a business teaches you things that no corporate role can. Understanding cash flow viscerally, managing risk with your own capital on the line, building client relationships where every project matters — these experiences inform how Pablo M. Rivera leads operations today.
